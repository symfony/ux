@kbond WDYT? If you're 👍 , probably we should create an interface and make that autowireable? I think the interface would have `render()` and `createAndRender()`, but not sure about `embeddedContext()`.

I'm 👍🏻 - this has been asked for a couple different times.

Agreed, let's make a `ComponentRendererInterface` - @WebMamba, would you like to create this? Let's leave `embeddedContext()` off the interface for now.

Hi ! Thanks @weaverryan and @kbond for your returns. I just push the interface. Maybe we should comment some docs for the function in the interface.

Hey @weaverryan and @kbond what's need to be done to get it merge ? Do I target the write branch ?

All's good! I'll merge later today.
