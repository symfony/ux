sorry for the small setback, I had some difficulties on the rebase of the branch 2.x :(

I had to do a force push because of my merge error.

Here are the changes after rebase and the pagination supports.
There have been some changes, a review would be welcome. thanks

Hi @weaverryan,

what should we do with this pr ? I have however tried to be reactive because we are waiting for this feature.

Maybe if `group_by` is not configured, it should return the results in the old format? Because for me it would now be a BC break

I think that's an excellent idea. It would make the PR a lot safer to merge üëç

Hello, I made some changes to keep the old format if the group_by option is not set.

Would you have some time to give some feedback ?
