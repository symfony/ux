@smnandre I believe there're might be some places to be improved, as I'm not the best to write docs, especially if most of them have some kind of standarization :D. So I'm open for any comments 🙌🏻.

A more sensible point here: i'd really like to warn users those values will be "readable" from front... or are they encoded i don't remember what choice was made in the end ?

@jakubtobiasz Thanks for this PR.

In my use case, we need to overwrite the `label`.
I solved it with this Code, and i think this is useful for others as well.
Maybe you can add this to the PR? Otherwise i can add a PR after this is merged.

```
#[AsEntityAutocompleteField]
class FooAutocompleteField extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildView(FormView $view, FormInterface $form, array $options): void
    {
        if(isset($options['extra_options']['label'])) {
            $view->vars['label'] = $options['extra_options']['label'];
        }
    }
```

```
class FooFormType extends AbstractType
{
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options): void
    {
      $builder->add('bar', FooAutocompleteField::class, ['extra_options' => ['label' => 'Overwritten Label']]);
   }
  ...
}
```

@smnandre being honest, this PR just fell out of my head 😅; I'll try to finalize it this ASAP.

But all good for me, a big big thank you :)
