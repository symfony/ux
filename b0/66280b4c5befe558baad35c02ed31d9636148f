It's a bit related to the PR https://github.com/symfony/ux/pull/1347?

A bit .. but the "recipe" term refer to a "cookbook recipe" more than a "component recipe" :)

How do you want to proceed @WebMamba here ? Do we review both content / feature here ? Or you prefer just the "code" part for now maybe ?

@smnandre lets focus on the code at first, and then on the content. Even if we do that in two times, I can keep the content of the recipe on this PR, I think it's better if we launch the cookbook with a first article.

@kbond  thanks, I use the front matter extension now, this is pretty cool!

@codisart  thanks for your review I applied your fix!
