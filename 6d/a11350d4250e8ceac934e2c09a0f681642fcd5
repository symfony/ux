Could you isolate them ? I don't think we need to run all tests in Browser every time we update a README file (i may exagerate a little bit here 👼 )

I don't get what you mean, Playwright/browser tests are ran only for Map's bridges when their **code** change.
Vitest's Browser mode is explicitly enabled for Map's bridges, and the CI run `tests-js` when code (outside documentation) has been modified. 🤔

Note that, in previous `tests-js` CI jobs, the duration is a bit higher than before but that's fine IMO, see https://github.com/symfony/ux/actions/runs/10644425330/job/29509168600?pr=2113
