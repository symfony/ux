Ha! I was about to say "No, all good - it's working" and then I saw the tests. Should be ok :). I'll check those. I tried all the affected demos - everything is working minus the small detail fixed by #1561, which is not new to 2.16

All good now - waiting for a GH sync issue to resolve so I can upgrade to include #1561
