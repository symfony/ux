I simply can't figure out how to make TomSelect keep the selected option value.

SO happy to say that this is ready ðŸ˜….

tl;dr TomSelect rearranges the `<option>` elements. If something "morphes" the `<option>` element like LiveComponents (or Turbo 8) does, TomSelect can't handle this. This PR removes morphing for the`<option>` elements for Autocomplete and fixes & improves how we reinitialize TomSelect if the option elements DO change.
