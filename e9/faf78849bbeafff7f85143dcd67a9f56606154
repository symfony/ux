So if i understand:
* during dev, you use ux_icon(foo), foo is magically downloaded from iconify and stored in cache
* if you call the lock method, it's saved in assets/icons (and can be committed)
* if you call another time lock with --force you can override the local one

This seem really sensible!

(+1 for the lint command idea)
