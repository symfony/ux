What do you think about making this a property-only attribute? Then for methods, we'll recommend either using `this.` or `computed.` (from #266)? I think this could help with documentation.

For making `form` available on `ComponentWithFormTrait`, I'm thinking we could use this syntax:

```
trait ComponentWithFormTrait
{
    #[ExposeInTemplate(name: 'form', getter: 'getForm')]
    private ?FormView $formView = null;

    // ...
}
```

We wouldn't have to rename `$formView`. The `getter` attribute argument wouldn't make sense for methods.

Hmm, ok. Let's do this. It doesn't prevent us from adding this later by popular demand, so I don't see any risk. üëç

I believe this to be ready.
