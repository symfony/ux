🆘  @kbond  😅

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oi! We don't run foundry's CI on PHP 8.4 yet - hopefully these are issues there. I've created an issue to track https://github.com/zenstruck/foundry/issues/687

@kbond sorry i was unclear 😓

I started on PHP 8.4 but there were deprecations on PHP 8.3..

So i decided to un-lock the Foundry version.

This PR failures come from me upgrading Foundry, but are on the current PHP version... and i'm a bit blocked here :/

i must have messed something in the upgrade

Hi @smnandre

I've opened a PR based on yours which fixes the CI

https://github.com/smnandre/ux/pull/2

I'm not really sure where the problem was coming from, though :sweat_smile:

Oh this is no nice, thank you !! 😃

I'll merge it in mine and we'll see from there..  as the CI does not run on my fork :)

Looks good....  (thank you very much!)) ..
Except Icon now stuck in something that looks to me related to ConsoleTest /  Foundry  !

I'm sorry 😅
