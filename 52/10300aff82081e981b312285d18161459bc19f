> I also realised there is no rule to include the symfony licence header in every PHP files, should we add it ?

Yup - that'd be great 👍

> [list_syntax](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer/blob/master/doc/rules/list_notation/list_syntax.rst) -> not sure to see the necessity of this rule, do we need it ?

No idea - we can remove it and see what happens. Reading your notes, if there are other changes you want to make, go ahead and make them and we'll see how they look.

I'm happy with this config :)

I'm gonna suggest some other CI updates now 👼
