I don't know if the symfony phpstorm plugin works with third party components, but it might incorrectly offer autocompletions for all properties on all components, because they're inherited from TurboStreamComponent.

I figured out I could use anonymous twig components, so here we are. Tags are now like:

```html
<twig:Turbo:Stream:Append target="#some-id">
    <div>Append this</div>
</twig:Turbo:Stream:Append>
```

Is there a specific reason why the attribute is called `target` and in the HTML using `targets`?

Good question. Turbo accepts both target and targets. The former accepts an HTML id, the latter a CSS selector.
IMHO this is provides bad DX. Using a CSS selector should be the only way: when reading `#id`, it's way clearer that we target an id, and also it's hinting that another CSS selector would work.

I'm for not supporting Turbo's target attribute.
Then, which name should we give to the CSS-selector attribute on our side? `target` looks the most sensible to me.
We could name it `targets`, but the "s" feels unnecessary.

I think `target` is the way to go, but maybe elaborate on the target/targets difference in the docs so people don't mistake the target attribute of the component with the HTML target attribute.

Nevertheless, great DX improvements with the two PR's üëç
