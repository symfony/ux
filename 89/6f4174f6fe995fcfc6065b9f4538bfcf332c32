Pinging some community members who are clearly using these library's: @Lustmored, @seb-jean, @norkunas, @allejo, @mdoutreluingne, @sabat24, @BeyerJC, @benr77. Any thoughts/objections?

None from me, using 6.0+PHP8.1 for the project

I think its a good idea. My projects are all >=5.4 , so lets go :-)

Same here - 6.0 and PHP8.1 only. In fact I was just thinking about that when making changes in test Kernel :smiley:

Keeping it up to date with last active Symphony's LTS version is perfectly fine for me.

Agreed - 5.4 as the minimum is fine by me and I also think it's sensible to make this change sooner rather than later.

It's totally understandable and acceptable to demand Symfony 5.4+, as it's an LTS release. Anyway, active projects have every interest in moving to Symfony 5.4 or more for security reasons and more... So let's go üëç

@symfony/mergers any objections?

No concerns here! Using PHP8.1 & Symfony 5.4 here ü•≥
