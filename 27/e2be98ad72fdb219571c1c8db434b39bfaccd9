This looks good to me! @simondaigre, can you fixup the CI and add some docs?

@kbond would you mind taking a look ? I can't figure out why they fail...

FYI @simondaigre, for future PR's, it'll be easier to use a new branch (rather than making changes on 2.x directly).

Understood. Thanks for your help !

CI is green.

- We should add a test for this feature. @simondaigre, would you like to add this or want me to add one?
- Can you add documentation?

You can add tests if you want. I'll do the docs tomorrow.

Will do, the test suite is a bit complex ðŸ˜¬

Doc updated. I have no clue to how to preview this. @weaverryan feel free to edit it if you want.

Tests added, @weaverryan, can you give a final review?
