Some things i noticed while coding the render:

The last code block will not work (wrong data attribute).

Some name with incorrect case (Symfony, UX, JS)

Some these/those i think.

The example with Header/Body to change, as they are slots/blocks and no isolated component (maybe use a button with an Icon inside?)

I'll make another review before monday :)

I believe my comments can be replaced by an automatic tool, do you think we can use https://github.com/get-alex/alex or https://github.com/textlint/textlint or https://github.com/huacnlee/autocorrect or anything better?
