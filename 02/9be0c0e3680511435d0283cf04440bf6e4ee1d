I've just seen that [the PR on Webpack Encore bundle](https://github.com/symfony/webpack-encore-bundle/pull/206) adds an `addOutlet()` function instead, but I feel it's more meaningful and less error prone to add it to the controller directly.

Also, should I PR against Encore bundle (v1) if this PR gets merged?
