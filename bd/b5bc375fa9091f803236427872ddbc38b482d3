Currently, this PR only adds a failing test demonstrating the problem reported in #1839. I could use some help to fix!

In [TwigPreLexer](https://github.com/symfony/ux/blob/2.x/src/TwigComponent/src/Twig/TwigPreLexer.php) , i guess `consumeAttributeName` should use another regexp than the one in `consumeComponentName`

But we need a lot of tests for this, as they cannot be class props !
