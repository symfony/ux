So if I'll have hundred live actions I'll need to write same number submit/reset statements? :)

Yup! The same as if you has a hundred controller actions ðŸ˜‰

BUT, I'm re-thinking this approach - I think it's flawed, as trying to "submit the form" then "change the data the form was created from" then... re-recreate the form with the new mix of data... just doesn't work, as the final "new" form wouldn't be "submitted", so it wouldn't have correct validation errors. If we re-submit the 2nd form, then we overwrite the new values we just changed in our underlying object. I think it's a dead approach.

I think the easier flow is to, in your actions, manipulate `$formValues` directly. This, I believe, is actually what you were doing all along @norkunas  - I was trying to do something fancier. It doesn't look as neat as manipulating the underlying form data DTO/entity, but it's much simpler. The flow in an action would be what you have currently @norkunas (I'm just arriving to the solution later). I still need to try it, and see if my fix for `getFormValues()` still works with your approach. Will check into it next week.

Yeah, at least I currently get them ðŸ˜‰

From a quick glimpse I can tell that this does not collide nor solve the problem addressed in my PR, which focuses on handling different kind of checkbox field types within forms :+1:

Other than a small TODO in the documentation, this is ready to go. This is much simpler now & mirrors what @norkunas was doing in his project, except now with the fix to `formValues`. It mentally took me awhile to get the clarity that this small solution was needed (I previously had a much bigger solution in this PR).

> So if I'll have hundred live actions I'll need to write same number submit/reset statements? :)

So now the answer to that is "no": your actions modify `formValues` and nothing else.

This is now ready. The form process is now much smoother, working with `CollectionType` is a wonderful experience.
