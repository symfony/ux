I've updated the PR description to show what will change.

Great ! Thanks you :)

Minor **if you have time**:
The description _may_ be _a bit_ missleading, as your PR has no impact on how you pass arguments to components, but how attributes are rendered.
Maybe illustrate with something in the "component view" instead of the "calling template" ?
