Merci Félix :eyes:

I've double-checked our packages and the LiveComponent is not the only one to have a hard requirement on `symfony/stimulus-bundle` and have a document telling people to install/configure the Stimulus Bundle. The other packages are:
- Chart
- Map
- React
- Svelte
- Vue
- Turbo

Can you remove the documentation from those packages as well please? 🙏🏻

/cc @smnandre we spoke about that some weeks/months ago :)
