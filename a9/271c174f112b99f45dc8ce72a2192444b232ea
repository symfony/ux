What about the logo to the left of the title?

Two reasons i kept it top of the title
* i wanted to change a bit from the "PackageBox", have some variety in card layouts
* i have something in mind for the top right space but i'd like to see if the page is used, first :)

But no problem if you prefer, i don't really mind here :))
