I don't understand why `.splice()` was used instead of a new array. Can't be for performance reasons, or can it?

Also, forgot to mention: I'd consider a regex to tokenize the string a more elegant solution.

Any objections against that?

Could you rebuild the packages ? (that's the origin of the CI failures)

(yarn run build from the repository root i think)

Of course! Didn't find anything in the docs and wasn't sure whether that's something that actually has to be done in the PR or will be done on release.

Yep this would need some CONTRIB file.. i'll open an issue :)

Do you think you could add a quick test, to prevent any future regression ? ðŸ˜Š

I would like to but I didn't see any browser tests in LiveComponents.

Could you point me in the right direction where actual browser integration is tested for `live_controller.js`?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by aleho at 2024-05-13T13:05:21Z

Never mind. I figured LiveComponent doesn't have any browser tests yet and tried to add them.

This PR got bigger than expected, please let me know if anything's missing.

@smnandre Any news? Did you have time to have a quick look at it?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by smnandre at 2024-06-04T04:28:25Z

Hello @aleho ! Sorry i've been crazy busy those last weeks...

Thank you **very much** for this!

I'm not sure we need right now a full panther stack with panther :| (really not sure there, but could this test be done like the others ?)

I'll let @kbond (that is his domain much more than mine to be honest) and @WebMamba check and give their opinion :))

My _personal_ impresion: we should maybe try to make the suggested changes in a smaller PR, and address the "panther tests" in a distinct one ? ðŸ¤·

No worries, we all know how it is.

There are already Panther tests for Turbo, which this PR is somewhat based on. The reason I think there's no other way to "reliably" test this is that it has to be run in a JS engine in a browser to break. Being the author of this PR I might be biased though. ;)

I can do that. On the other hand, the bigger part of this PR will only affect the tests / GitHub actions, so it's not going to have a lot of impact even if it breaks (and, as I said, Panther is already used anyway). Moreover this bug fix would not have a valid test case if it is split until the other part is merged as well.

This could have been a nice fix for 2.18, just saying ðŸ˜‰.

I'm still fine with either solution! Please just tell me how you'd like to move forward, but, please, don't let this sit for another month and then another for a release. ðŸ˜­

We've all been crazy busy around here these last weeks... it's an open source project you know, and we have limited time after work, family and stuff..

And believe me when i say we would all love to have more time ðŸ˜„

I just poked other regulars to come review this / give you feedback ... so that will be soon i think :)
