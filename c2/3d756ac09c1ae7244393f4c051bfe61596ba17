Curiously, this fails on PHP 8.3 but passes on 8.4 (deps=high).
It's going to be fun to debug... If anyone is up to having a look, help welcome :)

Those issues were caused because the assets were not reachable with the webserver/browser ran by Panther:

It was fixed by compiling assets with `asset-map:compile`.

Now all that's left is this issue and we'll be good to go :)

Super strange. I opened https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/16194 because this looks like a PHP bug to me.
