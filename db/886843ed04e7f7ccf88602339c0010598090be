Thank you for that @YummYume !

Could you rebuild the dist file ? It feels you updated those files "manually" (i may be wrong on this, TS is not my strongest force ðŸ˜… )

From the root of the monorepo, this should be enough i think

npm run build

(This is why the CI is red `Symfony UX / Check for UnBuilt JS Dist Files (pull_request) Failing after 1m`)

This is weird :thinking: I didn't touch the `dist` files I simply ran the `yarn build` command. And somehow the Autocomplete controller needed to be rebuilt. Now it's fine.

No idea why the LiveComponent tests aren't passing, though, they're all green.

Related to dependencies / Symfony 7.1.. and don't bother with Autocomplete if you're not working on it ... or you won't ever end this PR haha
