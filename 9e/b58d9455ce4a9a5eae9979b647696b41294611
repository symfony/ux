Rebased, I will update the PR to use the published version once it's live on packagist.

It's up on packagist now - there's not a release yet, but that's ok - we target `2.x-dev` on all the packages anyways.

I saw it was on packagist but didn't realized all packages were required with 2.x-dev.

I'll update this, thanks for the heads up.
