Currently renders incorrectly on website (https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-lazy-image/current/index.html#customizing-images-fetching):

I did not check how it will render after this change!

Hi, I've used `::` because the linter was not happy about it:
> Please do not use ".. code-block:: php", use "::" instead.

And so you have the same issue https://github.com/symfony/ux/actions/runs/9298650239/job/25590944633?pr=1876

IDK how to fix it properly tho

Hum, maybe removing the newline between `.. ::` and `namespace App\BlurHash;`?

When checking for existing examples, I mistakenly used examples from the vendor folder. Now I searched for existing examples that are not in vendor, though I still have not checked the built result.
