@cavasinf, does this sufficiently fix the two above issues for you?

Doesn't resolve #1704 because it's more "doc" related.
But certainly #1686 👍

Ok to merge this PR while continuing the discussion about the remaining problems @cavasinf  ?

Yes 👍
Remove the #1704 dependency as it will be closed with this PR 😉
