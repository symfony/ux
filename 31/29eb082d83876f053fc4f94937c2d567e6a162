Hello @Spomky

I quite like this component, do you think you could have time to finalize it (meaning fixing failing tests and marking the PR as ready when you have finished it)?

Hi @tgalopin,

Thank you for your interest in this UX component.
Sure I will take time to finish it.

Just one question to you or @weaverryan: I can see in all components that the `options` variable is populated using `this.element.hasAttribute` and `this.element.getAttribute` calls.

But in my component I do it this way:

```js
  const options = {
      strings: this.stringsValue || null,
      typeSpeed: this.typeSpeedValue || 30,
      smartBackspace: this.smartBackspaceValue || true,
      startDelay: this.startDelayValue || 0,
      ...
  };
```

Which one should I use?

OK I modified a few things, built it and all test pass.
Ready for your review.

Values are the way to go, the original packages will need to be updated to use them.

Reviewing now :)

Hi all,

I hope you are well.
I noted some changes in the `symfony/ux` repository and I've just updated this PR.
Let me know if you see something I may have missed.

Regards.

Ping @tgalopin and @weaverryan.
What do you plan for this repository? Is there any chance for other components like this one to be part of it?
Regards.

Hi @weaverryan,

Thank you very much for the code review and your message; it warms the heart ðŸ¤©.
And don't apologize for anything. I'm sure you were busy because for good reasons.

I think I have answered all the comments you have raised.
Also, I rebased the branch. It should be fine now.
Just ask if there is any modification I should do.
