~I was not able to update the asset-mapper recipe:~

```
The original recipe version you have installed could not be found, it may be too old.
Update the recipe by re-installing the latest version with:
  composer recipes:install symfony/asset-mapper --force -v
```

When I run `composer recipes:install symfony/asset-mapper --force -v`:

```
Executing script importmap:require
Executed script importmap:require  [OK]
Executing script importmap:require
Executed script importmap:require  [OK]
Executing script importmap:require
Executed script importmap:require  [OK]
Executing script importmap:require
Executed script importmap:require  [OK]
(repeated forever?)
```

_Edit, fixed, it was not repeated forever - I think one for each importmap entry?_
