Would using https://github.com/afcapel/stimulus-autocomplete be better?
In particular to reuse the controller :
https://github.com/afcapel/stimulus-autocomplete/blob/main/src/autocomplete.js

Tom Select (and this package) is focused on transforming `<select>` elements vs creating a generic "autocomplete" (e.g. a search bar where you have HTML results before). If you have that use-case, you can use that library, or live components where it's super easy to create this type of thing ("search bar where results load as you type").
