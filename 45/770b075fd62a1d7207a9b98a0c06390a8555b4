Hi @rrr63 ! Thank you for this PR

Could you add just a screenshot or two, for other to understand what you're adding ?

I'm wondering, you add on dragEnter, but you don't revert if the drag is canceled  ?

Also, it would be great to add a test or two :)

Hi @smnandre ,

You're right, i canceled when the drag leaves, and added a test for both, enter and leave.
Both, enter and leave are in the same test to get the right drag area from enter event.

Demo :

Could you add a entry in the CHANGELOG (inside the Dropzone folder) ? Next version will be 2.20
