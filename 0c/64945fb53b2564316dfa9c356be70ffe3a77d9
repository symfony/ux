I think should only allow 2.0. Otherwise you will have one lib trying to use stimulus and another using @hotwired/stimulus is you have a mix of 1.0 and 2.0

@kbond this is the issue you were talking about (we saw this also with twig/live components) - our test suite needs to be enhanced to catch these :)
