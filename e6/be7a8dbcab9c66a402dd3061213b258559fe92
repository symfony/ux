Cluster is common in design system and modern CSS layout compositions too ;)
* https://design-system.w3.org/layouts/cluster.html
* https://every-layout.dev/layouts/cluster/
* https://chrisburnell.com/article/cluster-composition/

A cluster is a bit more than an horizontal stack (but it would work here so i agree to use stack if you guys prefer)

The idea is to start using some layout / composition utilities on one hand (dealing with spacing and alignments)... and components (dealing with their inside)

Especially if we soon start using container queries..

So for me a BadgeGroup would not really bring something to the table.

(open to debate ofc)

@smnandre thanks for sharing these resources. I was **very wrong** and indeed `cluster` is a common word related to CSS layouts. Cheers!

I was surprised and -as always- probably did express myself badly ..

My intention was never to say you were _wrong_.. just wanted to bring some sources to illustrate.

Really sorry if i have made you feel any other way.

> What do you think about adding the author also on the page metadata ?

We can discuss it in another issue ? Or ill remove the badges from the cookbook for now.

This PR was just about merging badge (and was originally intended for the d√©mos).
