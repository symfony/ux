Thanks for this! The change just affects compiling the TypeScript, correct? It doesn't affect end-users?

Exactly. I encountered the problem after an automated dependency update didn't work because I couldn't compile to Javascript anymore.

Ok, thanks! I see this is still a draft - is there more to add? Or are you waiting on those 2 linked issues to see if the problem might be resolved/altered there?

I wasn't sure if there is something else to add.

Me either! But I also didn't see what the original build failure was. But this seems reasonable.
