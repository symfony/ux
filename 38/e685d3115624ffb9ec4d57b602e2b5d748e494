Just asking ... can you use `:` in the alias name? E.g. if someone wants to group all aliases under a common prefix (e.g. `site:...` or `acme:...`)

That's for sure the next step!

Hello, thank you for this implementation!

To have thought a little about this functionality, I propose the following modification:

Put an @ before the name of the alias

 This allows you to add an AliasNotFound error which would be easier to debug, and to only check the configuration file when calling an alias.
Also it increases readability: @dots directly gives us the information that the icon is an alias, and it also allows us to do things like
@user:login @user:logout @admin:login

@Xbirdfr the problem with that is that it introduces a new convention that all users of UX Icon must learn, which causes friction.

In any case, is `@` forbidden in icon aliases? If it's not, what you are asking it's already possible to do. If it's forbidden, let's double check if we should really forbid it.

@javiereguiluz I understand that, but as Icones Alias will be a new feature, I will cause less friction

Actually, if `@dots` is not referenced in the config, an IconNotFound error will be thrown, and this is not the good error message

With an @ we clearly know if we want an alias or not while using ux icon, and allow a better readability and debugging.

But it's maybe too much and I understand this, but I really think this will be a good way to handle alias

@javiereguiluz yep absolutely!

And we decided to avoid it in the TwigComponent shared by bundles, so it would be a bit strange to introduce it here.

>  @user:login @user:logout @admin:login

@Xbirdfr  This is precisely what i did not want to handle _for now_.  We have the ` : ` to identify a namespace/ icon set.

Full disclosure: i will open a PR after this one to implement the long-waiting "configuration per icon sets/directorys" ... so let's talk about namespaces aliases afterwards ðŸ˜…

I promised the simple aliases long time ago, and we have been poked again recently ... so this is more the context of this PR :)

Personally, I will use the aliases in several projects, to have simple "one-word-domain-icon-names"  for the 10/12 most used icons (which come from different sets -- excluding here any partial mapping). Something like this:

```yaml
# config/packages/ux_icons.yaml
ux_icons:
    aliases:

        # Logos
        github: 'simple-icons:github'
        twitter: ' pajamas:x'
        php: 'bxl:php'

       # Actions
       delete: 'tdesign:delete'
       add: 'material-symbols:add'

       # ...
```
