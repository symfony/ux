# Symfony UX Dropzone

Symfony UX Dropzone is a Symfony bundle providing light dropzones for file inputs
in Symfony Forms. It is part of [the Symfony UX initiative](https://symfony.com/ux).

It allows visitors to drag and drop files into a container instead of having
to browse their computer for a file.

**This repository is a READ-ONLY sub-tree split**. See
https://github.com/symfony/ux to create issues or submit pull requests.

## Sponsor

The Symfony UX packages are [backed][1] by [Mercure.rocks][2].

Create real-time experiences in minutes! Mercure.rocks provides a realtime API service
that is tightly integrated with Symfony: create UIs that update in live with UX Turbo,
send notifications with the Notifier component, expose async APIs with API Platform and
create low level stuffs with the Mercure component. We maintain and scale the complex
infrastructure for you!

Help Symfony by [sponsoring][3] its development!
