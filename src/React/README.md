# Symfony UX React

Symfony UX React integrates [React](https://reactjs.org/) into Symfony applications.
It provides tools to render React components from Twig.

**This repository is a READ-ONLY sub-tree split**. See

## Sponsor

The Symfony UX packages are [backed][1] by [Mercure.rocks][2].

Create real-time experiences in minutes! Mercure.rocks provides a realtime API service
that is tightly integrated with Symfony: create UIs that update in live with UX Turbo,
send notifications with the Notifier component, expose async APIs with API Platform and
create low level stuffs with the Mercure component. We maintain and scale the complex
infrastructure for you!
