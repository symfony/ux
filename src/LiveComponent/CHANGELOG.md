# CHANGELOG

-   Add `submitForm()` to `TestLiveComponent`.
-   Add `live_action` Twig function

## 2.18.0

-   Add parameter to `TestLiveComponent::call()` to add files to the request

## 2.17.0

-   Add `modifier` option in `LiveProp` so options can be modified at runtime.
-   Fix collections hydration with serializer in LiveComponents
-   Add `loading` attribute to defer the rendering on the component after the
    page is rendered, either when the page loads (`loading="defer"`) or when
    the component becomes visible in the viewport (`loading="lazy"`).
-   Deprecate the `defer` attribute.
-   Add `UrlMapping` configuration object for URL bindings in LiveComponents

## 2.16.0

-   LiveComponents is now stable and no longer experimental ðŸ¥³
-   [BC BREAK] The `data-action-name` attribute behavior was removed in favor of
    using Stimulus "action parameters" and `data-live-action-param`. This is a
    breaking change if you were using the `data-action-name` attribute directly
    in your templates. #1418

    To upgrade your application, follow these changes:

    ```diff
    <button
        data-action="live#action"
    -    data-action-name="debounce(300)|save"
    +    data-live-action-param="debounce(300)|save"
    >Save</button>
    ```

    To pass arguments to an action, also use the Stimulus "action parameters" syntax:

    ```diff
    <button
        data-action="live#action"
    -     data-action-name="addItem(id={{ item.id }}, itemName=CustomItem)"
    +     data-live-action-param="addItem"
    +     data-live-id-param="{{ item.id }}"
    +     data-live-item-name-param="CustomItem"
    >Add Item</button>
    ```

    Additionally, the `prevent` modifier (e.g. `prevent|save`) was removed. Replace
    this with the standard Stimulus `:prevent` action option:

    ```diff
    <button
    -    data-action="live#action
    +    data-action="live#action:prevent"
    -    data-action-name="prevent|save"
    +    data-live-action-param="save"
     >Save</button>
    ```

-   [BC BREAK] The `data-event` attribute was removed in favor of using Stimulus
    "action parameters": rename `data-event` to `data-live-event-param`. Additionally,
    if you were passing arguments to the event name, use action parameter attributes
    for those as well - e.g. `data-live-foo-param="bar"`. #1418

-   Reverted setting `ignoreActiveValue: true` in Idiomorph #1548
-   New placeholder macro to generate defer/lazy skeleton #1532
-   improve TestLiveComponent::actingAs() #1461
-   Drop Twig 2 support #1436
-   Add better error message when hydrating dates #1431
-   Store TemplateMap in build_dir #1525

## 2.15.0

-   [BC BREAK] The `data-live-id` attribute was changed to `id` #1484
-   Fixed child handling bug during re-rendering introduced with the
    new morphing library in 2.14.0 #1484
-   Fix bug where the active input would maintain its value, but lose its cursor position #1501
-   Restrict Twig 3.9 for now #1486

## 2.14.1

-   Fixed a regression in the testing tools related to the default HTTP
    method change

## 2.14.0

-   [BC BREAK] DOM morphing changed from `morphdom` to `idiomorph`. As this is
    a different morphing library, there may be some edge cases where the
    morphing behavior is different.
-   Add support for URL binding in `LiveProp`
-   Allow multiple `LiveListener` attributes on a single method
-   Requests to LiveComponent are sent as POST by default
-   Add method prop to AsLiveComponent to still allow GET requests, usage: `#[AsLiveComponent(method: 'get')]`
-   Add a new `urlReferenceType` parameter to `AsLiveComponent`, which allows to
    generate different type URL (e.g. absolute) for the component Ajax calls
-   The `symfony/serializer` dependency is now optional
-   Added a `data-skip-morph` attribute to allow skipping morphing of an element
    (the element's attributes will be morphed, but its inner HTML will be overwritten
    instead of morphed)
-   Added an entry to the packages' `package.json` file so that `@symfony/ux-live-component`
    will appear in the user's `importmap.php` file if using AssetMapper. This
    will allow using the JavaScript from the package without extra setup.
-   Fixed edge-case rendering bug where a 2nd Ajax request might start before
    the 1st finished processing
-   Fix usage of `{% embed %}` with `{% block %}` in `<twig:>` components
-   Fixed `data-loading` not working when on root element of a component
-   Fixed error when `class` attributes contained a space at start or end
-   Fixed loading directives being matched in a child component

## 2.13.2

-   Revert "Change JavaScript package to `type: module`"
-   Add capability to use validation groups in Live Components validation trait.


## 2.13.0

-   Add deferred/lazy rendering of Live Components.
-   Fix option tag synchronization.
-   Handle array-like objects when working with checkboxes.
-   Add Symfony 7 support.
-   Normalize "true" & "false" model values
-   Fix DTO hydration from phpdoc typehints.
-   Fix instantiating LiveComponentMetadata multiple times.
-   Change JavaScript package to `type: module`.
-   Throwing an error when setting an invalid model name.

## 2.12.0

-   Add support for (de)hydrating DTO classes in `LiveProp`.
-   Fixed `emit()` method of `TestLiveComponent` to properly test events.
-   Add `actionAs()` to `TestLiveComponent`.
-   Fixed rendering bug when using Chrome's translation feature.
-   Add `onUpdated()` hook for `LiveProp`.
-   Fix support for Alpine.js & live components.

## 2.11.0

-   Add helper for testing live components.
-   Add initial file upload support.
-   Respect `data-turbo="false"` when handling redirects.
-   Fix checksum calculation for deeply nested data.

## 2.9.0

-   Add support for symfony/asset-mapper

## 2.8.1

-   Increased the priority of `LiveComponentSubscriber` `ControllerEvent` from
    0 to 10 to fix incompatibility with SensioFrameworkExtraBundle.

## 2.8.0

-   [BC BREAK]: The `exposed` option was changed to `writable` in `LiveProp`:

```diff
-#[LiveProp(exposed: ['email', 'plainPassword'])]
+#[LiveProp(writable: ['email', 'plainPassword'])]
public User $user;
```

-   [BC BREAK]: `LiveProp` values are no longer automatically (de)hydrated
    through Symfony's serializer. Use `LiveProp(useSerializerForHydration: true)`
    to activate this. Also, a `serializationContext` option was added to
    `LiveProp`.

-   [BC BREAK]: Child components are no longer automatically re-rendered when
    a parent component re-renders and the value of one of the props passed to
    the child has changed. Pass `acceptUpdatesFromParent: true` to any `LiveProp`
    on the child component to re-enable this behavior.

-   Non-persisted entity objects can now be used with `LiveProp`: it will be
    serialized using the serializer.

-   Better support for using arrays with `LiveProp`.

-   Smart rendering system! If you have JavaScript that makes changes to
    the DOM inside a live component, those changes will now be _kept_ when
    the component is re-rendered. This has limitations - see the documentation.

-   You can now `emit()` events to communicate between components.

-   You can now dispatch DOM/browser events from components.

-   Boolean checkboxes are now supported. Of a checkbox does **not** have a
    `value` attribute, then the associated `LiveProp` will be set to a boolean
    when the input is checked/unchecked.

-   A `format` option was added to `LiveProp` to control how `DateTime`
    properties are (de)hydrated.

-   Added support for setting `writable` to a property that is an object
    (previously, only scalar values were supported). The object is passed
    through the serializer.

-   Invalid data sent by the user is now handled in a robust way. Previously,
    if the user sent invalid data (e.g. a string for a `LiveProp` that has
    an `int` type), the component update would break. Now, if the new data
    cannot be hydrated onto the object during a re-render, the last valid
    value is used.

-   When using `ValidatableComponentTrait`, a new `_errors` variable is sent
    to the template, which is easier to use!

-   Several bug fixes to parent - child components - see #700.

-   Fixed handling of boolean attributes to a component - see #710.

-   Fixed performance calculating component fingerprint for large components.

## 2.7.0

-   [BC BREAK]: The "key" used to load the controller in your `assets/controllers.json`
    file changed from `typed` to `live`. Update your `assets/controllers.json`
    file to change this key.

-   Add a strategy for adding a Stimulus controller to a Twig component - #589.

-   Added a new `getCompontent()` function in JavaScript as the best way to find
    a Component object for a given element.

-   Fixed various bugs related to child component handling - #596

-   Added a new `route` parameter to `AsLiveComponent`, which allows to choose
    another route for Ajax calls.

-   Add `assets/src` to `.gitattributes` to exclude source TypeScript files from
    installing.

-   TypeScript types are now included.

-   Added new `response:error` JavaScript component hook for custom handling Ajax errors - #587.

## 2.6.0

-   [BC BREAK]: The path to `live_component.xml` changed _and_ the import now
    MUST have a `prefix`: you should update your route import accordingly (the
    name of the route also changed to `ux_live_component`):

```diff
# config/routes/ux_live_component.yaml
live_component:
-    resource: '@LiveComponentBundle/Resources/config/routing/live_component.xml'
+    resource: '@LiveComponentBundle/config/routes.php'
+    prefix: /_components
```

-   Removed `Content-Type` header when returning the empty response redirect.
-   Fixed bug when re-rendering SVG's (.#557)

## 2.5.0

-   [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Previously, Ajax calls could happen in parallel (if
    you changed a model then triggered an action before the model update Ajax
    call finished, the action Ajax call would being in parallel). Now, if
    an Ajax call is currently happening, any future requests will wait until
    it finishes. Then, all queued changes (potentially multiple model updates
    or actions) will be sent all at once on the next request.

-   [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Fields with `data-model` will now have their `value` set
    automatically when the component initially loads and re-renders. For example,
    previously you needed to manually set the value in your component template:

    ```twig
    <!-- BEFORE -->
    <input data-model="firstName" value="{{ firstName }}">
    ```

    This is no longer necessary: Live Components will now set the value on load,
    which allows you to simply have the following in your template:

    ```twig
    <!-- AFTER -->
    <input data-model="firstName">
    ```

-   [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] The way that child components re-render when a parent re-renders
    has changed, but shouldn't be drastically different. Child components will now
    avoid re-rendering if no "input" to the component changed _and_ will maintain
    any writable `LiveProp` values after the re-render. Also, the re-render happens
    in a separate Ajax call after the parent has finished re-rendering.

-   [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] If a model is updated, but the new value is equal to the old
    one, a re-render will now be avoided.

-   [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Priority of `DoctrineObjectNormalizer` changed from 100 to -100
    so that any custom normalizers are used before trying `DoctrineObjectNormalizer`.

-   [BC BREAK] The `live:update-model` and `live:render` events are not longer
    dispatched. You can now use the "hook" system directly on the `Component` object/

-   [BC BREAK] The `LiveComponentHydrator::dehydrate()` method now returns a
    `DehydratedComponent` object.

-   Added a new JavaScript `Component` object, which is attached to the `__component`
    property of all root component elements.

-   the ability to add `data-loading` behavior, which is only activated
    when a specific **action** is triggered - e.g. `<span data-loading="action(save)|show">Loading</span>`.

-   Added the ability to add `data-loading` behavior, which is only activated
    when a specific **model** has been updated - e.g. `<span data-loading="model(firstName)|show">Loading</span>`.

-   Unexpected Ajax errors are now displayed in a modal to ease debugging! #467.

-   Fixed bug where sometimes a live component was broken after hitting "Back:
    in your browser - #436.

## 2.4.0

-   [BC BREAK] Previously, the `id` attribute was used with `morphdom` as the
    "node id" when updating the DOM after a render. This has changed to
    `data-live-id`. This is useful when maintaining the correct order of a list
    of elements.

-   [BC BREAK] If using `LiveCollectionType`, the name of the remove field changed
    from `button_delete_prototype` to `button_delete` and the add field changed
    from `button_add_prototype` to `button_add`. Additionally, the `allow_add`
    and `allow_delete` default values were changed from `false` to `true`.

-   [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] If an action Ajax call is still processing and a
    model update occurs, the component will _no_ longer re-render. The
    model will be updated internally, but not re-rendered (so, any
    model updates would effectively have the `|norender` modifier). See #419.

## 2.3.0

-   [BC BREAK] The `data-action="live#update"` attribute must now be
    removed from **nearly** all elements. This is because LiveComponents
    now automatically listens to the `input` event on all elements
    with a `data-model` attribute and updates the data. If you previously
    used `data-action="change->live#update"` to list on the `change`
    event, now you should use the `on(change)` modifier inside `data-model`.

```twig
<!-- BEFORE -->
<input
    data-model="max"
    data-action="change->live#update"
>

<!-- AFTER -->
<input
    data-model="on(change)|max"
>
```

-   [BC BREAK] The `live#updateDefer` action was removed entirely.
    Now, to update a model without triggering a re-render, use the
    `norender` modifier for `data-model`:

```twig
<!-- BEFORE -->
<input
    data-model="max"
    data-action="live#updateDefer"
>

<!-- AFTER -->
<input
    data-model="norender|max"
>
```

-   [BC BREAK] The `name` attribute is no longer automatically used to
    update a model when a parent component has `data-action="change->live#update"`.
    To make a form's fields behave like "model" fields (but using the
    `name` attribute instead of `data-model`) you need to add a `data-model`
    attribute to the `<form>` element around your fields (NOTE: the
    new attribute is automatically added to your `form` element when
    using `ComponentWithFormTrait`):

```twig
<!-- BEFORE -->
<form data-action="change->live#update">
    <input
        name="max"
    >
</form>

<!-- AFTER -->
<form data-model="on(change)|*">
    <input
        name="max"
    >
</form>
```

## 2.2.0

-   The bundle now properly exposes a `live` controller, which can be
    imported via your `assets/controllers.json` file (like any other
    UX package). Previously, the controller needed to be imported and
    registered with Stimulus directly (usually in your `assets/bootstrap.js`
    file). That is no longer needed.

-   Add a generic `LiveCollectionType` and `LiveCollectionTrait`
-   Allow to disable CSRF per component

## 2.1.0

-   Your component's live "data" is now send over Ajax as a JSON string.
    Previously data was sent as pure query parameters or as pure POST data.
    However, this made it impossible to keep certain data types, like
    distinguishing between `null` and `''`. This has no impact on end-users.

-   Added `data-live-ignore` attribute. If included in an element, that element
    will not be updated on re-render.

-   `ComponentWithFormTrait` no longer has a `setForm()` method. But there
    is also no need to call it anymore. To pass an already-built form to
    your component, pass it as a `form` var to `component()`. If you have
    a custom `mount()`, you no longer need to call `setForm()` or anything else.

-   The Live Component AJAX endpoints now return HTML in all situations
    instead of JSON.

-   Ability to send live action arguments to backend

-   [BC BREAK] Remove `init_live_component()` twig function, use `{{ attributes }}` instead:

    ```diff
    - <div {{ init_live_component() }}>
    + <div {{ attributes }}>
    ```

-   [BC BREAK] Replace property hydration system with `symfony/serializer` normalizers. This
    is a BC break if you've created custom hydrators. They'll need to be converted to
    normalizers.

-   [BC BREAK] Rename `BeforeReRender` attribute to `PreReRender`.

## 2.0.0

-   Support for `stimulus` version 2 was removed and support for `@hotwired/stimulus`
    version 3 was added. See the [@symfony/stimulus-bridge CHANGELOG](https://github.com/symfony/stimulus-bridge/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#300)
    for more details.

-   Require live components have a default action (`__invoke()` by default) to enable
    controller annotations/attributes (ie `@Security/@Cache`). Added `DefaultActionTrait`
    helper.

-   When a model is updated, a new `live:update-model` event is dispatched. Parent
    components (in a parent-child component setup) listen to this and automatically
    try to update any model with a matching name. A `data-model-map` was also added
    to map child component model names to a parent - see #113.

-   Child components are now re-rendered if the parent components passes new data
    to the child when rendering - see #113.

-   Minimum PHP version was bumped to 8.0 so that PHP 8 attributes could be used.

-   The `LiveComponentInterface` was dropped and replaced by the `AsLiveComponent` attribute,
    which extends the new `AsTwigComponent` from the TwigComponent library. All
    other annotations (e.g. `@LiveProp` and `@LiveAction`) were also replaced by
    PHP 8 attributes.

Before:

```php
use App\Entity\Notification;
use App\Repository\NotificationRepository;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\LiveAction;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\LiveProp;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\LiveComponentInterface;

final class NotificationComponent implements LiveComponentInterface
{
    private NotificationRepository $repo;

    /** @LiveProp */
    public bool $expanded = false;

    public function __construct(NotificationRepository $repo)
    {
        $this->repo = $repo;
    }

    /** @LiveAction */
    public function toggle(): void
    {
        $this->expanded = !$this->expanded;
    }

    public function getNotifications(): array
    {
        return $this->repo->findAll();
    }

    public static function getComponentName(): string
    {
        return 'notification';
    }
}
```

After:

```php
use App\Entity\Notification;
use App\Repository\NotificationRepository;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\AsLiveComponent;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\LiveAction;
use Symfony\UX\LiveComponent\Attribute\LiveProp;

#[AsLiveComponent('notification')]
final class NotificationComponent
{
    private NotificationRepository $repo;

    #[LiveProp]
    public bool $expanded = false;

    public function __construct(NotificationRepository $repo)
    {
        $this->repo = $repo;
    }

    #[LiveAction]
    public function toggle(): void
    {
        $this->expanded = !$this->expanded;
    }

    public function getNotifications(): array
    {
        return $this->repo->findAll();
    }
}
```

## Pre-Release

-   The LiveComponent library was introduced!
