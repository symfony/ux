# Live Components

Live components work with the [TwigComponent](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html)
library to give you the power to automatically update your
Twig components on the frontend as the user interacts with them.
Inspired by [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and
[Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html).

Create real-time experiences in minutes! Mercure.rocks provides a realtime API service
that is tightly integrated with Symfony: create UIs that update in live with UX Turbo,
send notifications with the Notifier component, expose async APIs with API Platform and
create low level stuffs with the Mercure component. We maintain and scale the complex
infrastructure for you!
