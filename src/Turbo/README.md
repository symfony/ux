# Symfony UX Turbo

Symfony UX Turbo is a Symfony bundle integrating the [Hotwire Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev)
library in Symfony applications. It is part of [the Symfony UX initiative](https://symfony.com/ux).

Symfony UX Turbo allows having the same user experience as with [Single Page Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
but without having to write a single line of JavaScript!

Symfony UX Turbo also integrates with [Symfony Mercure](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mercure.html)
or any other transports to broadcast DOM changes to all currently connected users!

You're in a hurry? Take a look at [the chat example](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-turbo/current/index.html#chat-example)
to discover the full potential of Symfony UX Turbo.
