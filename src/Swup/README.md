# Symfony UX Swup

Symfony UX Swup is a Symfony bundle integrating [Swup](https://swup.js.org/) in
Symfony applications. It is part of [the Symfony UX initiative](https://symfony.com/ux).

Swup is a complete and easy to use page transition library for Web applications. It creates
a Single Page Application feel to Web applications without having to change anything on the server
and without bringing the complexity of a React/Vue/Angular application.
