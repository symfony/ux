Hmm, the `/` would be required for #802. Is is possible to allow it for any character but the last?

Unless we force a `.` syntax instead - that's another thing Blade components do. This would be my preference, at least for now. It'll make life simpler - and we could consider adding `/` back later.

> By allowing the / character in https://github.com/symfony/ux/pull/806, we introduce a bug. You can't now use the self-closing syntax because it enters in conflict with the component name

The tests on #806 were passing, so we must be missing a test-case for this. Can you add one in this PR to "prove" the bug that you're fixing?

This would disallow adding .html.twig but I'm fine with that. "Anonymous twig template files must end in .html.twig". If someone has a use-case where this doesn't work for them we can re-evaluate.

I just push a test for it 👍

This is also my thought :

I just want to avoid the code being more complex for edge cases. Forcing the `.` syntax as Blade does is the way to go for me.
