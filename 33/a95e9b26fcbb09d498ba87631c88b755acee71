@smnandre Yes that should be it, the doc as well. I'm just not sure what version I should use in the changelog entry.

The failing test surprises me a bit ... @WebMamba any idea ? I feel we may have exposed more than we wanted

Looks like this is related to the PR: https://github.com/symfony/ux/pull/1940.

Hummm the test looks flaky. I don't think this is related to this PR though
