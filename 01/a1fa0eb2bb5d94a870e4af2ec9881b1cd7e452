Thank you very much for this PR @rrr63 üëç

I think @Kocal will lead the review here :)

@Kocal Thank for your comments, i fixed it.
You are right ! It will not break any apps because of `info-window:before-create` & `info-window:after-create`.
And it seems more accessible for future additions

However, I wonder because a test did not pass on the Autocomplete component by just changing the Map's changelog ...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Weird, it works by adding the changelog : `Polygons added` but didnt work with `Adding polygons` ... :)

I've just merged #2117, you will need to rebase your PR and add `polygons` support to `ux_map()` and `<twig:ux:map>` aswell, thanks üôèüèª

Feel free to ask help if needed

Hello @Kocal
Any tips on how could i resolved this conflicts ?
Do i have to do it  locally or on github ?

Thanks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Locally after a rebase on 2.x

You need to rebase / fix the conflcits / force-push here :)

Now it's a bit hard to review 90 files üòÖ

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by smnandre at 2024-09-18T22:08:42Z

I'll add then a couple of comments, regarding argument order and default values :)

Oh so sorry,

Do you think it will be easier for you if I create a new PR?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Kocal at 2024-09-19T07:04:43Z

I will see what I can do

I like it very much ! Would you agree, afterwards, to help me prepare a demo using polygons on the website ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by rrr63 at 2024-09-21T07:31:11Z

Yes I could, with pleasure :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Kocal at 2024-09-24T05:52:18Z

I'm taking care of the rest, rebasing and fixing conflicts, testing the feature on my side, and merge :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working as expected:

I've also added some documentation and squashed everything.
I'm merging after CI becomes green
