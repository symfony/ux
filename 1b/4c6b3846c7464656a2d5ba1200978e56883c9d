I've been -more than once- told we cannot do this or that for way, way smaller BC breaks.

But if you guys say it's ok, that's ok for me.

`ignore_missing` exist in Twig (include, source) too. It was my inspiration here for the name ... and felt very similar

Every other filter / function i know of throw in Twig when an error occurs

The only silent thing is for getAttribute.

To me an icon (which should be in cache) is nothing like an attribute on an (existing) object.

The asset function throw when an asset does not exist (example: a svg icon)

--

If we use strict_variables here, I _cannot_ have exception in prod for missing icons anymore.

(i would need to set strict_variables to true -- something i don't desire for obvious reasons)

Not in the mood for the subtext of this discussion.. so just tell me your decision and i'll update the PR.
