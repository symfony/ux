When using the turbo stream chat demo, I get the following error when posting a message in chat:

![Failed-to-send-an-update-500-Internal-Server-Error-](https://github.com/symfony/ux/assets/127811/8dc4a9d4-94f9-4d81-b311-04420c041f9b)

Must be to do with the `MERCURE_URL` variables in .env but not sure how to fix (or what to set it to locally).

About the Mercure stuff, hmm. Iirc, using Docker + the `symfony` binary should set those automatically... though I'm not seeing that locally right now. I talk very specifically in a tutorial about this, but I can't seem to see the `MERCURE_` env vars locally...

I should note that when I reload the page, the chat box contains my message - so appears some kind of side-effect is failing.

@kbond I think I fixed it over on #965 - looks like wrong flag, or an outdated flag (I'm sure this worked at some point - I've used this locally).
