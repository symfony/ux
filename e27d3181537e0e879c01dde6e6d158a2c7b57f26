Thanks for the reproducer test - super useful. I can't think, immediately, what the problem might be - maybe something in morphdom? Unless someone beats me to it (which would be great!) I'll check it out when I have some time.

Thought about morphdom too, but they have svg tests,so not sure how this could happen currently..

Found the root cause and added a fix.
