Hi @javiereguiluz, the function has been renamed to `ux_map` in #2073, but it looks like it has not be released yet.
That's why you are seeing `ux_map` in the doc, but `render_map` in the code ðŸ˜•

Ah ok! Thanks for checking this. I've reverted the function name change and kept the other doc changes. Thanks.
