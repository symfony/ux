Thank you for the kind words! I have a big rebase to do first, and we'll see then :)) But if i miss one it's not volontary :)

from my experience it's way easier to rebase when you have a single commit only :)

The challenge here was to manage a file that had been deeply modified by two separate pull requests (PRs).

In reality, this shouldn't have been a problem, and it was a mistake on my part to work on this file at the same time as @kbond ðŸ˜„
