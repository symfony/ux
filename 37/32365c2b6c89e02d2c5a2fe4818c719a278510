Yeah I know about the 0 day since the last JS framework/tools meme... and trust me it's not for nothing my TN is "JS hate account" :trollface:

Biome is a community-fork from [Rome](https://github.com/rome/tools) (started 3 years ago), it's a tool I was really looking forward to because of the over-fragmentation of JavaScript tools and the unnecessarily complex configurations to make them work together.
I love having a tool that does a lot, but mostly **well**. ... &lt;troll>Next PR, Bun to replace Yarn/Vitest/Rollup? :eyes: &lt;/troll>)

I consider Biome enough "production-ready", to nicely and quickly lint and format our JS(X)/TS(X) files.

What about editor integration? Did you tried the PHPstorm extension? Do you think it's mature enough?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I didn't know an extension existed, and so I didn't try it. But I'm not a big fan of ESLint/Prettier integration in IDEs, I prefer relying on CLI / CI / pre-commit hook :D

I'll try it next week (late in the week) !

This looks like a nice addition. Do you think this is ready for merge or would you like to wait for more feedback and/or changes? Thanks!

Hey, I think this PR would need a last rebase on `main` before merging.
I will do it this afternoon

The PR has been rebased and CI checks are passing, feel free to merge it if you like it :eyes:
